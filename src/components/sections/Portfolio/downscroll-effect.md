Here’s the clear answer in simple words 👇

## What’s the name?

* **Scroll‑driven hero fade (parallax fade/scale)**
* Aka **scroll‑linked animation** where the **hero fades, shrinks a bit, and moves up** as you scroll down. Your project already uses **Framer Motion** for animations, so this fits right in.

## How it works (concept only — no code)

1. **Watch the page scroll** – we read the page’s scroll position (how far down you are).
2. **Map scroll → visuals** – we convert that scroll value into three effects on the section container:

   * **Opacity:** 1 → 0 (slowly disappears)
   * **Scale:** 1 → \~0.95 (looks like going “back”)
   * **Y‑position:** 0 → −60px (slides gently upward)
3. **Result:** When you **scroll down**, the section feels like it’s going behind and hiding. When you **scroll up**, it returns smoothly.
4. **Performance:** Only transform the **outer section wrapper** (not every child) for smooth FPS.
5. **Accessibility:** If the user chooses **reduced motion**, we **turn this off** and show static content.

## What you want (“hero moto sob section e”)

You want **the same hero scroll effect on all sections**, and you **don’t want left/right slide-in animations**. That’s exactly what we described—apply the same **fade + small scale + up‑shift** to each section’s **top wrapper**, and remove any side slide entrances (keep hover effects, CTA pulses, etc.). Your site already documents a **floating navbar that hides on scroll down and shows on scroll up**, so this style is consistent with the current UX.

## Short checklist to implement (for your team/Claude)

* Apply hero‑style **scroll fade/scale/up‑shift** to these sections: Flagship Product, Complete Portfolio, Success Stories, Integrations, Partners, FAQ, Final CTA.
* **Remove** all left/right entrance animations; keep hover micro‑interactions.
* **Mobile tweak:** smaller effect (e.g., tiny scale change) so text stays readable.
* **Reduced motion:** disable scroll animations.
* Test smoothness across desktop & mobile.

If you want, I can drop this into your repo docs as a tiny “implementation brief” so devs can follow it step‑by‑step.
