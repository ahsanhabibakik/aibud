# Objective
Create a high‑impact **Portfolio** page for AI Buddy that showcases our shipped and in‑progress products, case studies, and integrations. Design must **blend the current AI Buddy aesthetic** (dark, cinematic, neon accents) with **Linktree‑style playfulness and motion** (smooth reveals, friendly micro‑interactions), while remaining accessible, performant, and conversion‑oriented.

---

## Audience & Outcomes
**Primary visitors:** prospective SMB/solopreneur clients, startup partners, and ecosystem collaborators.

**Top outcomes:**
1) Quickly understand our breadth (flagship + supporting products).  
2) Skim a few proof points (metrics, logos, screenshots) and **book a call**.  
3) Explore deeper: product details and live demos/links.

---

## Visual Direction
- **Theme:** Keep AI Buddy’s current dark/navy base with soft gradients and glassy panels. Accents use the existing lime/teal and violet highlights from the main site—not Linktree’s full rainbow.  
- **Texture:** Subtle noise and light streaks in hero (mirroring the landing page header), **never** overpowering content.  
- **Shape language:** Rounded 18–24px corners, pill CTAs, soft shadows.  
- **Imagery:** Product screenshots in framed devices (laptop/phone) with gentle reflection. Use blur‑glow around hero art to echo the flagship Agent GG card.  
- **Iconography:** Simple duotone icons that read on dark backgrounds.  

> **Inspiration to borrow from Linktree**: clear hierarchy, bold friendly headlines, animated cards that feel alive, and delight via micro‑interactions—not loud color.

---

## Page Architecture (top‑to‑bottom)
1) **Sticky Sub‑Nav (local to Portfolio)**  
   Tabs/filters pinned under the global navbar: *All, Flagship, Marketing, Ops & Sales, Productivity, Reporting, Integrations, Mental Health, Dev/Infra*. On mobile this becomes a horizontal scrollable chip row.

2) **Hero — “What We’ve Built”**  
   - Left: punchy heading and short subtitle (2 lines max).  
   - Right: animated mosaic of 6–8 product tiles that gently float in (see Motion spec).  
   - Primary CTA: **Book a Call**. Secondary: **Browse All Products** (jumps to grid).

3) **Flagship Spotlight — Agent GG**  
   - Large card with short value bullets, one KPI/quote, and a demo thumbnail.  
   - Inline mini‑carousel for *Use Cases*: Solopreneurs, SMB Teams, Productivity Geeks.  
   - CTA: **Learn about Agent GG**.

4) **Product Grid (filterable)**  
   - 2–4 columns depending on viewport.  
   - Each card contains: logo/emoji, product name, category tag, 1‑sentence value, 2–3 key capabilities as chips, tiny metric or status ("Live", "Beta", "Concept"), and a **Learn More** link.  
   - Hover reveals: screenshot peek or short GIF.

5) **Featured Case Studies**  
   - 2–4 tiles with brand logo, outcome headline (e.g., “–42% manual ops time”), 60–90 word summary, and CTA to full write‑up.  
   - Include a small *“How we did it”* strip listing the components used (products + integrations). No tech names.

6) **Integrations Wall**  
   - Grid of partner logos (ClickUp, Google Calendar, Gmail, Slack, Stripe, QuickBooks, Telegram, Claude, ChatGPT, Brevo, *+Add your SaaS*) with short one‑liners under a hover state.  
   - Include a **“Request an Integration”** CTA.

7) **Process + Credibility Row**  
   - 3‑step process graphic (reuse main site copy) with small real screenshots per step.  
   - Trust bar with Microsoft for Startups / Invest Ottawa / other partner badges.

8) **FAQ (Accordion)**  
   - 5–7 common questions focusing on scope, timelines, data safety, and customization.

9) **Conversion Footer**  
   - Short prompt: “Ready to bring your agent to life?” inline email field + **Book a Call** button.  
   - Social proof micro‑line: “Projects spanning ops, marketing, and wellbeing.”

---

## Motion & Interaction (Linktree‑inspired, but on‑brand)
**General rules**  
- Durations 200–450ms; curves are smooth and friendly.  
- Respect reduced‑motion preferences: swap animations for instant fades/transforms.  
- Keep FPS high—no large parallax or heavy Lottie.

**Hero Mosaic**  
- Product tiles slide up and slightly scale from 0.96 to 1 on load (staggered).  
- Very gentle float/hover (1–2px vertical drift) with slow loop.

**Cards & Buttons**  
- Hover: lift 4–6px, shadow deepens, accent border animates from left to right.  
- Chips: subtle wiggle on hover; tap gives a soft press state.  
- “Copy link / View demo” micro‑toast slides in from bottom center.

**Scroll Reveals**  
- Section titles fade/slide from 8–12px with stagger for children.  
- Case study images mask‑reveal from a soft gradient.

**Integrations Wall**  
- On hover, each logo gently tilts and reveals a one‑liner opacity fade.  
- “+ Add your SaaS” pulses every ~6s to invite action (reduced motion disables pulse).

**Accordion**  
- Expand/collapse with springy height change; caret rotates 90°. Focus visible at all times.

---

## Content Strategy & Copy Blocks
**Tone:** confident, human, helpful. Short sentences. No jargon.

**Headlines (examples):**  
- *Work we’re proud of, built with you in mind.*  
- *From idea to impact, faster.*

**Microcopy patterns:**  
- Value first: “Cut manual bookkeeping, keep the insights.”  
- Outcome chips: “Automates inbox triage”, “Turns docs into decisions”, “One‑click dashboards”.

**CTAs:** Book a Call · View Demo · Read Case Study · Request Integration · Explore Agent GG

---

---

## Components (Design System Level)
1) **Product Card**  
   - Header: emoji/logo, name, category.  
   - Body: value sentence + capabilities chips.  
   - Footer: status badge + small proof + actions.

   - Large hit area, keyboard navigable, focus‑visible.

5) **CTA Bar**  
   - Sticky on mobile after 50% scroll; includes “Book a Call”.

---

## Accessibility & Inclusivity
- Minimum contrast AA for text and buttons on dark backgrounds.  
- Focus outlines always visible; tab order mirrors visual order.  
- All motion respects reduced‑motion preference with equivalent non‑motion states.  
- Alt text for all decorative/product images; avoid motion‑triggered content that traps focus.

---

## Performance & SEO Guardrails
- Optimize all gallery images/screens via modern compression and proper sizing.  
- Lazy‑load below‑the‑fold visuals; defer non‑critical animations until visible.  
- Descriptive titles/meta per product; structured data for *Product* and *SoftwareApplication* where appropriate.  
- Internal links to existing site sections (Services, Integrations, Process) to reinforce relevance.

---

## Content & Asset Checklist
- Logo suite (AI Buddy + partner badges).  
- 1–2 clean screenshots per product (desktop + mobile frame when relevant).  
- Short value statements and 2–3 capability chips per product.  
- 2–3 case studies with outcome headline and 1 graphic each.  
- Integration one‑liners.  
- FAQ copy (5–7 items).  
- UTM‑tagged links for all external demos.

---

## Navigation & IA
- Add **Portfolio** to global nav between *Product* and *Services*.  
- In Portfolio, item detail pages (or modals) link to related items ("Built with:" chips).  
- Back‑to‑Portfolio breadcrumb on detail views.

---

## Copy Starters (edit freely)
- **Hero title:** *Work we’ve shipped. Results we can replicate for you.*  
- **Hero subtitle:** *A curated look at agents, automations, and tools we’ve built for founders and small teams.*  
- **Agent GG blurb:** *Your decision co‑pilot. Lowers cognitive load, focuses you on revenue‑makers, and scales across a small team when you’re ready.*

---

## QA Walkthrough (what to verify before publish)
- Filters correctly show/hide items; URL query preserves state for sharability.  
- Hover and focus states visible on all interactive elements.  
- Motion disables cleanly with reduced‑motion preference.  
- All public links open in a new tab with descriptive titles.  
- Lazy‑loaded images swap without layout shift (reserve aspect ratios).  
- Mobile sticky CTA never covers essential controls.

---

## Success Metrics (post‑launch)
- Portfolio → Book a Call CTR ≥ prior site average.  
- Avg. time on Portfolio ≥ 1.6× global average.  
- Scroll depth ≥ 60% for first visit sessions.  
- Link clicks on public demos (easeyourmind, docdirector, etc.).

---

## Notes on Style Parity with Main Site
- Reuse the existing card style, shadows, and button shapes.  
- Keep typography scale consistent with landing page; headlines match hero sizing.  
- Gradients and sparkles are accents—content stays legible.

---

## Layout Grid & Breakpoints
- **Container max width:** 1200–1280px on desktop; 16–24px page padding on mobile, 32–40px on tablet.
- **Grid:** 12‑column desktop, 8‑column tablet, 4‑column mobile. Gutters 20–24px desktop, 16–20px tablet, 12–16px mobile.
- **Cards:** min 296px width; maintain **16:10** media aspect for screenshots; text area auto grows up to 4 lines.
- **Tap targets:** ≥44×44px; spacing scale uses 8px base (8/12/16/24/32/48/64).

## Color & Type (stay within current brand)
- Reuse existing dark/navy background and neon accents from the landing page hero.  
- Headings: current display font/weight; body text: legible sans with 1.55–1.65 line‑height on desktop, 1.7+ on mobile.  
- Links and CTAs use the existing accent color; provide a **high‑contrast focus ring** distinct from hover.

## Page Architecture (precision addenda)
**Keep existing sections** and apply these refinements:
- **Sticky Sub‑Nav Chips:** add subtle progress underline that tracks scroll position; active chip locks to the left on mobile when scrolled. URL reflects state via category query for sharable views.
- **Hero:** include a compact **KPI strip** (e.g., projects shipped, industries served) under the subtitle; each number animates from 0–target on first view. 
- **Flagship Spotlight:** include a quote/metric badge and a 15–25s muted demo loop with pause/hover control.  
- **Product Grid:** add **Sort** (Newest, Most Impact, A–Z) alongside Filters. Enable search with synonyms (e.g., “report” finds *Sheet to Dashboard*).  
- **Case Studies:** lock tiles to 2 per row on desktop for readability; each has a “Built with” chip list.  
- **Integrations Wall:** provide a **Request Integration** inline form (name, email, SaaS); confirm with a toast and success state.  
- **Conversion Footer:** duplicate primary CTA inline with an email field; include short privacy note.

## Portfolio Filters — Behavior Specs
- **Default:** *All*. Selecting a chip filters instantly (no page reload).  
- **Multi‑select:** allow one **Category** + optional **Status** (Live, Beta, Coming Soon).  
- **Persistent state:** keep filters and scroll position when navigating into a detail modal/page and back.  
- **Empty state:** friendly message + quick links to *All* and nearest categories.

## States & Feedback
- **Loading:** skeleton cards (image placeholder + 2 text bars + chips).  
- **Errors:** inline, human language (no codes) with a “Try again” action.  
- **Success toasts:** for actions like “Copied demo link”, “Request sent”.  
- **Reduced motion:** replace lifts/slides with opacity fades; disable float loops.

## Motion — Fine Tuning (Linktree‑inspired)
- **Durations:** 220–420ms; entrance stagger 60–90ms per item (max 8).  
- **Easing:** gentle ease‑out for entrances; springy ease‑in‑out for accordions.  
- **Lifts:** hover rise 4–6px with soft shadow growth; border/shine sweeps 300ms.  
- **Mosaic float:** translateY ±1–2px on a 6–8s loop; pause on hover/focus.  
- **Accessible skip:** add a *Skip animations* control when reduced‑motion isn’t auto‑detected.

## Content Rules per Product Card
- **Name** (≤28 chars)  
- **1‑line value** (≤100 chars): outcome over features.  
- **2–3 capability chips** (verbs + nouns, ≤18 chars each).  
- **Status badge**: Live / Beta / Coming Soon.  
- **Proof**: metric or client note (or “Metric on call”).  
- **Actions**: Learn More · View Demo · Copy Link (if public).  
- **Asset**: one screenshot (16:10), optional phone mock for mobile‑first tools.

## Imagery & Asset Guidelines
- Provide **1–2 clean screenshots** per product; crop clutter; hide sensitive data.  
- Use device frames only when it clarifies context (mobile‑first vs desktop).  
- Compress to ≤160KB per image where feasible; hero mosaic tiles ≤120KB each.  
- Reserve aspect ratio boxes to prevent layout shift.

## Accessibility — Detailed
- Add **Skip to content** and **Skip to filters** links.  
- Sub‑nav chips form a **radio group** pattern for single‑select; announce active category.  
- Accordions use headings semantics; arrow keys move focus within the list.  
- All CTAs have descriptive labels (e.g., “Book a call about Agent GG”).

## Performance Budgets & Guardrails
- **LCP** ≤ 2.5s on 3G Fast; **CLS** ≤ 0.1; **TTI** ≤ 3.5s.  
- Initial portfolio payload target ≤ 180KB gz (excluding fonts); defer non‑critical imagery.  
- Limit simultaneous animations in view to ≤ 10 elements.  
- Lazy‑load below‑fold media; prefetch next/prev product detail when idle.

## Analytics & Measurement (no implementation details)
- Track: Filter use, Sort use, Card hovers, Detail opens, Demo link clicks, Book‑a‑call clicks, Form submits.  
- Segment by category and status to learn what resonates.  
- Compare Portfolio CTR vs site baseline post‑launch.

## QA & Acceptance (expanded)
- Filter state persists through navigation; deep links restore state.  
- Keyboard can reach every interactive element in a sensible order.  
- Focus never becomes obscured by sticky components.  
- Reduced‑motion renders equivalent, comprehensible states.  
- All external links have titles and open safely in a new tab.
